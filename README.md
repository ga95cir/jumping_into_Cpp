# Jumping into C++

The aim of this repository is to collect the solutions for Alex Allain's "Jumping into C++". So far, my plan is to solve the practise problems from chapter 10 onwards. If I find the time, I will try to also include the solutions to chapters 1-9. Since the goal of this project is to improve my C++ skills, I will try to solve as many problems as I can. The following list gives an overview over which practise problems have already been solved:

+ __Chaper 10:__ Problems 2, 3, 4 and 5 are solved (out of 6 problems in total).
